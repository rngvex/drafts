# Duty and Sacrifice

The first real cold had settled in, sharp enough to bite through wool and stone alike, and the end of the year loomed close. [[House Stonehome]] prepared for the Hearthbound Vigil as it always had, with quiet efficiency and no small measure of tension beneath the surface.
Carriages arrived throughout the day, wheels crunching over frost-hardened ground as members of the house returned from scattered duties and distant holdings. One by one, they passed beneath the gate and into the keep, bringing with them the low murmur of reunion and the unspoken understanding that, for this night at least, everyone was expected to be present.
Winter had not yet closed its fist. But it was close. One by one, the heirs of House Stonehome gathered in the courtyard, their arrivals measured and deliberate. Braziers along the perimeter were lit as dusk settled in, flames crackling to life and casting the manor in warm bands of orange and gold. Firelight filled nearly every space, clinging to stone and timber alike, a quiet defiance against the cold pressing in from beyond the walls.
Ignatius Stonehome was the first to arrive.

He stepped down from his carriage without hesitation, cloak already unfastened, as if the journey from the High Lords’ court in the Heartlands had been little more than an inconvenience. The first heir carried himself with the ease of someone accustomed to being observed. Long golden-brown hair, a Stonehome trait as unmistakable as their name, fell neatly down his back, and his face bore the same hard lines as their father’s, softened only by time spent far from the frontier.
He paused briefly, taking in the courtyard, the braziers, the frost gathering at the edges of the stone. Then he moved forward, boots ringing against the ground, returning to a house that had never truly stopped being his, no matter how far he had traveled from it. 

The yard was awash with wagons, guards, and the steady movement of the house’s people. Grain stores were being sealed and tallied, set aside for brewing or preservation through the late winter months. Servants moved in organized groups, passing one another with practiced efficiency, each absorbed in some final detail.

Carriages continued to arrive through the gate, bearing the remaining sons and their entourages, the sound of iron-shod wheels echoing across the stone. Ignatius watched it all with a practiced eye, taking stock without appearing to do so.

Something was missing. Not supplies. Not preparation. People. For the Hearthbound Vigil, the yard should have been crowded to the point of discomfort. This was a celebration. A night when the lord finalized appointments, when House Stonehome broke bread with its servants, when the strain of another hard, successful year was set aside in favor of warmth and tradition. Sebik Stonehome was not a man who neglected such things. And yet the space felt… thin.

Too many familiar faces were absent. Too many corners stood open where there should have been bodies, voices, laughter waiting to spill over. The work was being done, yes, but by fewer hands than Ignatius remembered. He frowned slightly, the expression brief enough to go unnoticed.

_So where are all the servants?_
A bandwagon caught his eye.

It was unmistakably Stonehome make, the same heavy carriages built here on the frontier, shaped from northern hardwood by the estate’s own masters. The lines were familiar, the construction solid, built to endure bad roads and worse weather. And yet something was wrong. The crest was missing.

No green field. No tower. No flame. The panels where House Stonehome’s mark should have been were left bare, deliberately so. Ignatius slowed, his gaze sharpening as he watched the wagons being loaded with serious provisions, not the sort meant for trade or ceremony. Grain, preserved meats, winter gear. The kind of supplies meant for distance, not display. His jaw tightened. Was his father sending someone away?

He followed the movement of the servants with his eyes, and that was when he saw something truly interesting.

Xeria stood near the wagons, overseeing the loading with quiet efficiency. Thane’s attendant. Ignatius remembered her well enough, competent, sharp, far too composed for her age. A head maid, certainly, but still only the attendant of a sixth son. That, more than the missing heraldry, unsettled him.

Whatever was happening here required discretion. Not the casual kind, but the sort that warranted stripping a Stonehome wagon of its crest, an act that did not happen without approval. Orders had been given. Carefully. Intentionally.

And they had not come through him.
Why Thane?
And why was he not told?

Ignatius felt the shape of a scheme taking form, incomplete but undeniable. Something was being moved under the cover of tradition and routine, and Thane was standing far closer to its center than his station suggested. If nothing else, it promised to make for an interesting vigil.

A servant passed nearby, close enough that Ignatius could have stopped him with a word. He almost did. Almost. Instead, he let the man go. There would be time to consult his little brother soon enough.

The cold was beginning to bite through his olive winter coat, the frontier’s chill already clawing for purchase. Ignatius turned away from the yard, committing the scene to memory as he made his way toward the gate.

The wagons of Aurelian Stonehome came next.

This was not an arrival so much as a procession, the kind lifted whole from a history book and set gently into the present. The horses moved as if trained to march in rhythm, hooves striking the frost-hardened ground in near-unison. The spacing was precise. The pace deliberate. Nothing hurried, nothing wasted.

Men rode where men were expected. Supplies were secured exactly as regulation demanded. Even the guards bore themselves differently, posture straight, eyes forward, as though reminded by proximity alone that they were part of something older than themselves.

Aurelian did not announce his presence. He never needed to. Order arrived with him, quiet and unquestioned. He was a man of few words, his expression as unreadable as worked stone.

At a glance, one might have taken him for a military man, but the discipline he carried was not born of war. It came from a deeper fascination with how things were meant to be done, how they always had been. Command and order suited him, not as tools of dominance, but as methods of preservation.

Though he was younger than Ignatius, his face looked older, lines set deep by habit rather than hardship, his hair already touched with gray at the temples.

Cassian Stonehome arrived as if the yard itself had decided to breathe again.

His carriage barely came to a halt before voices followed him out, laughter, greetings, the easy cadence of someone who knew half the names already and learned the rest without effort. He stepped down with a hand already extended, clasping wrists, exchanging words that sounded personal even when they could not possibly have been. Servants straightened without realizing why. Guards smiled before remembering themselves.

Cassian moved through the crowd rather than above it, olive-green cloak worn loose, crest visible but never emphasized. Where Aurelian imposed order by presence alone, Cassian dissolved tension by acknowledging it, a word here, a glance there, smoothing edges before they could cut.

He looked every inch a Stonehome son, but where his brothers carried weight, Cassian carried momentum. His expression was open, his eyes quick, always measuring not strength or hierarchy, but mood. Who was anxious. Who was tired. Who needed reassurance more than instruction.

He believed, sincerely, that most problems could be talked down if one listened long enough. It was not naïveté, it was faith, earned through practice. Cassian did not command loyalty. He invited it.

And for a moment, watching him move through the yard, it was easy to believe that the house might yet speak its way out of winter.

The green banners hung in the grand entrance hall of the Stonehome estate, crowning the walls with the legacy this holiday evoked. Braziers burned along the length of the space, their flames reflected in polished stone until the hall seemed awash in warm orange light.

Servants moved through the crowd with practiced ease, some offering welcome drinks, others shouldering luggage and directing arrivals toward their quarters. It was busy without being chaotic, the sort of motion that came only from repetition and care.

Ignatius took it in for a moment, then headed directly toward Lady Erika Stonehome.

He had missed her more than he had expected.

“Mother,” he called politely, his voice carrying just enough to reach her as his eyes found her across the hall.

Lady Erika turned at the sound of his voice, her expression softening at once. She wore green, of course, but the cut of the dress was simple and functional, the sort that allowed for movement without fuss. No unnecessary lace, no trailing hems. A lady of the frontier, even on a night of tradition.

“Ignatius,” she said, relief threading her smile as she reached for him. She did not embrace him as tightly as she might have once, but she held his hands for a moment longer than necessary, as if confirming that he was truly there. “You’ve been gone too long.”

“You say that every time,” he replied, the stiffness he carried into the hall easing as he inclined his head. “And every time, you’re right.”

She studied his face with the same careful attention she once reserved for scraped knees and winter fevers. “You look thinner.”

“The court feeds its guests well enough,” Ignatius said lightly. “But it lacks certain comforts.”

Her mouth curved, but her eyes remained sharp. “Comforts can be arranged,” she said. “Provided one is willing to work for them.”

He glanced around the hall, the banners, the servants moving with quiet purpose. “It seems you’ve done just that.”

“We always do,” Erika replied, following his gaze. “This house doesn’t keep itself standing.”

There was pride in her voice, but also something else, an edge of concern she did not name. Ignatius felt it settle in his chest, familiar and unwelcome.

“Is Father about?” he asked, keeping his tone casual.

Erika’s smile did not fade, but it stilled. “He’s occupied,” she said. “As is Thane. They’ll join us shortly.”

As he turned back toward the hall, his brothers were already locked in a conversation he had witnessed a thousand times. Aurelian stood opposite Cassian, the two of them like ice and fire.

“Oh, come now, brother,” Cassian was saying, a warm, teasing smile set easily on his face. “They treat me exceedingly well in the warmer lands. You’ll worry yourself, and Mother, to death for nothing.”

Aurelian did not return the smile. “That is only because you discard every semblance of rank and form the moment it inconveniences you,” he replied, voice gruff and even. “Flirting with the court ladies of powerful lords, and their daughters besides. Would it truly kill you to respect _some_ of the noble laws?”

Cassian’s grin widened. “Oh, I very much believe it would.”

Ignatius caught himself smiling despite himself, savoring the familiarity of the exchange before stepping into the crossfire.

“You two never change,” he said. “Aurelian, I believe our younger brother enjoys the attention far too much to ever quit. But you are correct.” He turned his gaze to Cassian. “The last time you courted Lady Jane Mistral, I had to call in no fewer than a dozen favors just to persuade the court enforcers to stop trying to arrest you on sight.”

Cassian lifted his cup in mock salute.

“You would do well to cultivate a little foresight,” Ignatius continued mildly. “Or providence. Whichever arrives first.”

Cassian nearly spat his mulled wine. “_Providence?_” he echoed. “Igi, you’re joking. Please tell me you’re joking.”

As if on cue, the last two missing brothers entered the hall, ushered in by their mother, no doubt having been roped into the final preparations for the Vigil.

Javik and Trello paused at the threshold, eyes sweeping the gathering of Stonehome progeny as the space filled around them. Javik’s grin came easily, bright and unguarded, as though the sight itself were fuel. Trello took it in more carefully, slower, already reading what others missed.

Ignatius watched them approach and felt that familiar, disquieting sense of time catching up to him. Returning home always did that. It reminded him, with uncomfortable clarity, that the world did not wait. They were men now.

Trello was lean and well-built, his strength evident not in bulk but in balance. He carried himself with the quiet assurance of a practiced fighter, controlled, deliberate, every movement measured.

Javik, by contrast, looked like motion given shape. Spring-loaded, eager, alive with restless confidence. There was heat in his presence, not contained so much as _enjoyed_, the sort that leapt gladly toward challenge rather than shying from it. He looked like someone who loved the fight not for what it won, but for the act itself. Both of them would bring pride to the Stonehome name.

Servants passed by, and Ignatius’s coat was already being folded in the way he had seen a thousand times before. He barely registered the moment. Some habits were older than memory.

Then the welcoming began in earnest. Mugs of hot mulled wine were pressed into waiting hands, steam curling up into the rafters. Large wooden platters followed for those who had traveled with the sons, bread and meat set out without ceremony. The scent of spice filled the hall, warm and familiar, and for a moment it truly felt like home again.

Jorah, Javik’s attendant, leaned in just enough to be heard. “Stand up straight,” he murmured. “You’ll ruin your fighting posture.”

Javik groaned, but obeyed. Ignatius almost smiled. The old fox had always known how to trick them into behaving like the lords they were meant to be, all without ever sounding like a command.

And yet something was still missing.

Their father was not there to meet them. That, more than anything else, marked the moment as wrong. Sebik Stonehome had never missed a Vigil welcome, not once.

Ignatius suspected the absence had crossed every mind in the room, but the relief of returning home dulled the edge of it. Jubilation outweighed anomaly, for now.

He considered pointing it out. The thought lasted only a moment. It would turn into a twenty-minute argument, end with him fetching their father anyway, and accomplish nothing in the meantime.

So Ignatius set his mug aside and turned toward the stairs. He knew where Sebik would be, holed up in the upper study where the house went quiet when decisions could no longer be delayed.

If there was still work to be done on a day like this, it meant the situation had already reached last resort.

The upper study smelled of old ink and burned wax.
Ignatius noticed it immediately, that sharp, familiar scent turned sour by overuse. Candles had been allowed to gutter down to nothing and replaced mid-burn, wax pooled and scraped away without care. The desk had been cleared and buried again, maps layered atop one another in a way that would have offended Sebik on any other night.
Tonight, nothing was sacred.
Stonehome intelligence lay exposed. Patrol routes overlapped grain ledgers. Trade roads were inked and re-inked where certainty had eroded. Older military charts, the kind Ignatius remembered from childhood lessons, had been dragged out and pressed into service beside newer, more precise surveys. Pins marked intersections, some pulled free and stabbed back elsewhere, leaving the parchment scarred.
Sebik stood hunched over the table, both hands braced against the wood as if it were the only thing holding him upright. He looked older than Ignatius remembered, not in years, but in weight. Dark circles sat heavy beneath his eyes, carved by nights that had ended without sleep.
Thane stood opposite him, posture straight but rigid, shoulders tight with held tension. His hair was uncombed, eyes rimmed red, attention fixed on a manifest he had already read too many times. Ink stained his fingers.
No one spoke when Ignatius entered.
They didn’t startle. They didn’t turn.
They simply made room.
Ignatius closed the door behind him and stepped forward, eyes sweeping the table once. He did not ask what was happening.
“What’s the timing?” he asked.
Sebik exhaled, slow and controlled. “Tonight,” he said. “Or tomorrow morning, at the latest.”
Ignatius nodded. His gaze followed the inked lines converging toward the estate like veins. “The Vigil,” he said quietly.
“If I were them,” Sebik replied, “I’d choose it.”
Everyone present. Tradition binding attendance. A justification ready-made, preventative action, necessary intervention. The kind of moment that ended houses cleanly, with witnesses to sanctify the act.
Sebik dragged a finger across one of the maps, smearing ink where patrol routes overlapped. “This isn’t posturing,” he said. “Stormbolt isn’t angling for concessions. They mean to end us.”
Ignatius stilled. “All of us?”
“Yes,” Sebik said without hesitation.
Thane looked up then, eyes sharp despite the fatigue. “The timing lines up. Unrest has peaked. Grain hasn’t arrived where it should have. Winter’s pressing early. People are scared, and scared people make noise.”
“And noise gives justification,” Sebik said. He shifted another marker inward. “Stormbolt forces have been sighted along the southern roads. Not in colors. Not in formation. Hired blades. Caravan guards. Auxiliary levies traveling as merchants.”
Ignatius studied the markings, jaw tightening. “They’re covering the lands.”
“They hate this house,” Sebik said quietly. “They always have. And now they have the excuse they’ve been waiting for. When they move, it won’t be a duel. It won’t be a siege. It’ll be a cleansing.”
The word hung in the air, heavy and ugly.
“If they strike during the Vigil,” Thane said, already moving the conversation forward, “everyone’s here. Leadership. Bloodline. Witnesses. It looks decisive. Necessary.”
“And irreversible,” Sebik finished.
Ignatius exhaled slowly. “Then there is no saving it.”
“No,” Sebik said. “Only reducing the body count.”
Thane tapped the edge of the parchment, drawing their attention back. “The wagons,” he said. “If they carry the crest, they become statements. Targets. If Stormbolt decides to interfere, those marks make it easy.”
“The craftsmanship gives them away regardless,” Sebik said.
“I know,” Thane replied. “But recognition isn’t the same as targeting. Bandits will notice. Anyone looking for opportunity will. Anyone looking for us won’t.”
He traced a familiar artery of ink across the map. “Popular roads. This time of year, traffic is thick. Merchant convoys, winter provisioning, pilgrims moving south before the passes close. If Trello and Javik travel with that flow, not ahead of it, not behind it, they disappear into it.”
“Bandits,” Sebik repeated.
“Yes,” Thane said. “But not hunters.”
Ignatius leaned in, studying the intersections. “The western trade roads are saturated,” he said. “Enough movement to drown two more wagons.”
Sebik looked at him then, really looked, and something in his expression eased. Not hope. Relief.
“They’ll need escorts that don’t look like escorts,” Sebik said.
“I’ll arrange it,” Ignatius replied. “Men whose absence won’t raise questions. Paid through intermediaries.”
Thane nodded once. “The servants go first. The last rotation leaves before dawn. Anyone left after that stays because they chose to.”
Sebik closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, his gaze was steady. “I should have seen it sooner.”
“You did,” Thane said quietly. “You just hoped it would be enough.”
Silence settled, broken only by the distant murmur of voices from below, laughter rising and falling as cups were filled and old stories retold. The Vigil was in full swing.
Sebik straightened, shoulders squaring with effort. “Then it’s decided,” he said. “Trello and Javik leave under the ceremony. Bastion, by name and by writ. No one questions that.”
Ignatius nodded. “I’ll see to the roads.”
Thane slid the manifest across the table. “Take this,” he said. “Burn it when you’re done.”
Ignatius took the parchment, feeling the weight of it settle into his hands.
Sebik glanced toward the door. “We should return,” he said. “They’ll be expecting us.”

When Sebik finally left to prepare for the late welcome speech, the study went still.
For the first time that night, no one was issuing orders.
Thane crossed the room and nearly collapsed onto the leather couch along the far wall, sinking into it with a weight that felt wrong for someone his age. He let his head fall back against the armrest, forearm draped across his eyes, breathing out slowly, as if the tension had only just remembered it was allowed to leave.
Ignatius watched him for a moment longer than was polite.
Then he shut the door.
“You look like hell,” he said, not unkindly.
Thane let out a quiet huff. “You should see the ledgers.”
Ignatius smiled faintly and leaned back against the desk instead of sitting. He always avoided the chairs in this room. Thane remembered that. Something about never getting too comfortable where decisions were made.
“How are things in the capital?” Thane asked, voice muffled. “Less chaotic than home, I hope.”
“Aurelian handles most of the tedious work,” Ignatius said. “Cassian makes sure none of it stays quiet. Between the two of them, Stonehome is remembered.”
He paused. “But yes. Less immediate than this.”
“Good,” Thane murmured. “Someone should have a normal life.”
Ignatius snorted softly. “You say that like you ever wanted one.”
Thane shifted, lowering his arm just enough to look at him. “I wanted time,” he said. “That’s not the same thing.”
Ignatius considered that, then nodded. “Fair.”
Silence settled between them, the kind that didn’t need filling. Distant laughter drifted up from below, softened by stone and distance.
“I know what you’ve been doing,” Thane said eventually. “In the capital. The meetings. The favors. The compromises.”
He let his arm fall fully now, eyes tired but clear. “It’s not easy carrying a house’s name when everyone’s waiting for you to stumble.”
Ignatius exhaled slowly. “Someone has to stand where they can see us,” he said. “Someone has to make sure we don’t vanish quietly.”
Thane’s mouth curved, just barely. “You’ve always been good at being seen.”
“And you’ve always been good at the parts no one notices until they’re missing,” Ignatius replied.
The words sat there, honest and unadorned.
“How many have we saved?” Ignatius asked.
Thane’s shoulders rose and fell once. “Not nearly enough,” he said. “It’s been like trying to scoop sand into a pile while a gale closes in. Every time I think we’ve stabilized something, the wind shifts.”
He stared at the ceiling. “I keep thinking there’s one detail I missed. Something small enough to fix.”
Ignatius shook his head. “If it were small,” he said quietly, “it wouldn’t have needed you.”
That earned him a look. Brief. Sharp. Appreciative.
“I’m so tired,” Thane said, almost to himself.
Ignatius didn’t rush to answer. He straightened his coat instead, smoothing a crease that didn’t need smoothing.
“You know,” he said, “if circumstances were different, we’d still be up here at dawn. You arguing trade routes. Me pretending not to be impressed.”
Thane let out a breath that might have been a laugh. “You never pretended very well.”
“No,” Ignatius agreed. “I really didn’t.”
For a moment, the study felt like it used to. Not safe, but familiar.
Then the weight crept back in.
“When this is over,” Ignatius said quietly, “you don’t get to carry it alone.”
Thane closed his eyes. “That wasn’t the arrangement.”
“I know,” Ignatius said. “I’m changing it.”
They stood there a few seconds longer, two brothers who could have talked all night, if the world had allowed it.
Sebik Stonehome appeared at the top of the foyer steps just as the murmur of the hall began to swell.
Conversation ebbed naturally as heads turned, voices lowering without command. The Lord of Stonehome paused there for a moment, framed by the green banners and firelight, letting the room settle on its own. He did not raise a hand for silence. He had never needed to. Years of habit did the work for him.
Ignatius stood at his right, one step back, posture straight and composed. Thane waited at his left, closer to the banister, hands folded loosely in front of him. The symmetry was not accidental.
Sebik descended the steps at an unhurried pace, boots striking stone with soft, deliberate steps. He stopped at the base of the stairs, close enough that the first rows of servants and guards stood within arm’s reach, far enough that the rest of the hall could still see him clearly.
Only then did he speak.
“Thank you all for attending the fires of the Hearthbound Vigil with us,” he said, voice carrying easily across timber and stone. “I am glad that all of Stonehome’s sons have returned, as have all of you.”
A ripple of assent moved through the crowd. Some smiled. Others bowed their heads. For many, this was the only night of the year when the house gathered as one, lords and servants alike.
“This year has not been an easy one,” Sebik continued, taking a few slow steps forward as he spoke, closing the distance between himself and the assembled household. “But it has been a strong one. We endured the frontier as we always have, together, through diligence, through labor, and through loyalty to one another.”
He gestured lightly with one hand, indicating the hall around them, the banners overhead, the firelight reflecting off polished stone, the people who gave this place its rhythm. “Stonehome stands because you stand. Because you work. Because you remember who you are, even when the cold presses close.”
There was pride in his voice now, quiet but unmistakable.
“As is tradition,” he said, turning back toward the steps, “some among us will depart before winter sets its teeth fully into the roads. They go with my blessing and with the house’s trust, to represent us beyond these walls.”
Trello and Javik stepped forward from the edge of the gathering as if drawn by the words, coming to stand a pace below Sebik. The crowd shifted to make room for them, faces turning, recognition and approval passing easily between neighbors.
Sebik placed a hand on Trello’s shoulder first, firm and steady. Then he rested his other hand on Javik’s, fingers tightening briefly before settling.
“Trello and Javik will travel south at first light, bound for Bastion,” he said. “They go not as exile, nor as retreat, but as duty. They carry Stonehome with them, as all our sons do, wherever they stand.”
Javik straightened instinctively under his father’s hand. Trello inclined his head, solemn and composed.
A murmur followed, approval and understanding woven together. Bastion was a known quantity. A respectable posting. A sensible one.
Sebik lifted his mug, the motion mirrored throughout the hall a heartbeat later.
“To the hearth that binds us,” he said. “To the fire that keeps us whole. May it burn warm through the winter, and may we all return to it when the snow thaws.”
Mugs were raised. The toast came back louder this time, voices overlapping, filling the hall until it pressed against the walls.
Along the front of the gathering stood the heads of the outer holdings, millers and reeves and captains of the wall, men and women whose authority was older than titles. They raised their mugs with the rest, expressions sober but steady. 
Sebik stepped back, releasing Trello and Javik, the formal moment complete. The brothers rejoined the gathering, hands clapped against shoulders, quiet words exchanged as conversation flowed back into place. Someone struck up a tune near the far wall, soft and familiar.
The Vigil continued.
As the night wore on, the fires burned lower. Servants moved through the hall to bank the braziers and clear the last of the platters, boots whispering over stone. Voices thinned as people drifted away, guided by memory to rooms they had slept in since childhood.
Doors closed softly along the upper halls. Footsteps faded. The estate settled.
By the time the last candles were extinguished, House Stonehome lay wrapped in quiet, secure in the certainty of walls that had always held.
Above it all, winter waited.
