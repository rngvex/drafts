# The Cold Wind Calling

The clinking of metal filled the front yard of the [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] estate once more. This time it wasn’t brothers crossing blades, but [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] and his instructor, Trisha Threnbow. At a glance she could have passed for a common adventurer, and that was very much by design. Her slim longsword moved with effortless precision, elegant and economical. She left openings, but never by mistake, each one a lure meant to draw Thane into striking at the wrong moment.

For long stretches, the clash of steel was all that existed. The training was well above the basics, fit for nobility and punishing all the same. Thane focused on footwork and posture, knowing a single lapse would put him on the ground in seconds.

Then she changed pace. Threnbow lunged, closing the distance with her guard still intact. Thane braced and shifted his weight, preparing to block or deflect, but after an hour of relentless pressure his response came a fraction too slow.
The strike landed hard. Hard enough to buckle Thane’s knees, but not enough to drop him. For a heartbeat they were locked together, steel pressed to steel, Trish grinning openly as she leaned into the bind.
“Running out of steam, Thane?” she teased, flexing as she tried to force him down.
It was the tone that got to him.
Was he not giving everything he had? Fighting so he might live another day. Fighting so that they all could.
“Conductive Current Breathing.”
The words left his mouth before he fully realized he’d spoken them. His lungs burned as he drew the breath in, felt it settle, then circulate. Ambient mana rushed to meet it, threading through muscle and nerve alike. Static snapped from his skin and discharged into the ground as strength flooded back into his limbs.
He held his ground.
Trish’s grin widened.
Thane gritted his teeth. If he was going to do this, he would commit.
“Lightning Attunement.”
The world sharpened.
Movement resolved into intent. Muscle impulses, shifts of balance, the subtle tension that preceded motion, all of it laid bare. Trish’s posture was suddenly obvious, every angle and opening illuminated with painful clarity.
She broke the deadlock first, dodging back with a laugh, already preparing for what would follow.
Thane moved.
The earth cracked beneath his foot as he launched forward, the impact ringing like a thunderclap. His strike drove Trish back several meters despite her guard, boots skidding through dirt as she absorbed the blow.
She blocked. Barely.
Thane didn’t stop.
He drew deeper, this time through his mana core, the charge already forming as it gathered, shaped by instinct rather than incantation. The air thickened, ionized, faintly luminous as power condensed between them.
Trish inhaled slowly.
“Swordsmaster’s Spirit Channeling.”
Her stance shifted, blade extended, body leaning forward as if inviting the attack. The pressure in the courtyard spiked, mana density heavy enough to taste.
Their eyes met.
Thane raised his off-hand and released the spell.
Lightning leapt toward her—
—and was cut cleanly in half.
In the same instant she was on him.
Her hand closed around his face, momentum carrying them both down as she drove him into the ground with bone-jarring force. The breath left his lungs in a sharp, helpless gasp.
When his vision cleared, Trish was already standing, offering a hand with the same easy grin as before.
“Good,” she said. “Very good.”
Thane lay there, staring up at the winter sky, chest burning, heart racing.
Good wasn’t enough.
Not yet. 

“You’ve trained well, young lordling,” she said as she eased back. “The progress is visible. Still too weak for the life of a hunter or adventurer, but soon, I think you could pass as C-rank.”

“Thank you, Miss Threnbow,” Thane replied, steadying his breath. Trisha moved in and hauled Thane up from the ground she had so curtly introduced him to. [[Xeria]] stood nearby when he regained his footing, taking a moment to orient himself.

“I’ve been training,” Thane said, catching his breath, “but I see I’m still lacking.”

Trisha snorted softly. “You handle a sword better than most sellswords I’ve seen, but you’re still young. Your father has you training hard. That much even I can tell.” She sounded comfortable saying it, at ease with the lordling.

“I put myself through this training of my own accord,” Thane replied evenly.

“Master Thane,” Xeria said, stepping forward, “are you ready? I’ve drawn a bath for you in your quarters.”

“Ah, I see. Thank you, Xeria. And thank you as well, Mistress Trisha. It was an honor, as always,” Thane said, inclining his head to his instructor before turning and heading in Xeria’s direction. Trisha returned a brief farewell and took her leave.

The walk back toward the manor was uneventful. That, more than anything, unsettled him. Outwardly, Thane moved as he always did, measured, composed. Inside, his thoughts were anything but. His father’s words echoed again and again, striking the same place each time with quiet certainty.

_Our house will not survive._

From the way Sebik had said it, this wasn’t a warning meant to provoke action. It was a statement of fact. A position already reached. And that frightened Thane more than any imagined enemy, because he couldn’t yet see where the last move had been taken—or how many had already passed him by.

“You usually spend more time chatting with your trainers,” Xeria remarked, her voice light, as if noting nothing more than habit.

Thane exhaled slowly. The service corridors were quieter, narrower, stone worn smooth by generations of people meant not to be seen. He preferred them.

“Xeria,” he said after a moment, keeping his eyes forward, “how many moves ahead do you think an opponent needs to be before they know, for certain, that they cannot lose?”

She didn’t answer immediately. That, too, was routine. “Enough that they stop reacting,” she said at last.

Turning left on the third floor, they slipped into a tea kitchen barely large enough for four, completely hidden within the thickness of the outer walls. To anyone not familiar with the routes, it would have seemed as though they had simply appeared on the floor.

From there, Thane stepped into his bathing chamber, Xeria following without comment.

“Please, shut the door,” he said quietly.

Steam from the square, ornate bath had already begun to fog the windowpanes overlooking the gardens beyond. He was grateful, not for the heat itself, but for the fact that it was magically sustained. As he loosened his training gear and began to undress, he spoke more to the air than to her.

“How are we this far behind…”

Sinking into the bath, steam closing around him, Thane finally allowed his thoughts to slow—just enough to hurt. He let the water rise to his shoulders and stared at the fogged glass for a long moment before speaking.  
“Xeria… did you understand what my father and I were discussing earlier?”

She folded her hands at her waist. “I understood that it was important,” she said carefully. “Beyond that, no. Politics was never my training.”

“That’s fine,” Thane replied. He sounded tired now, more than shaken. “This isn’t really about politics anyway. It just wears the shape of it.”

He shifted slightly, the water sloshing. “On the frontier, houses survive because everyone agrees it’s easier to let them. Grain flows, patrols overlap, favors get returned. None of it is written down. It just… works. Until it doesn’t.”

Xeria nodded once, following.

“Our harvest failed,” he continued. “That alone isn’t fatal. Winter always hurts someone. But if grain shipments arrive late, or don’t arrive at all, unrest follows. Not because people are cruel, but because they’re cold and hungry. And unrest gives others permission to act.”

“To intervene,” Xeria said.

“Yes. To ‘restore order.’” Thane’s fingers tightened against the stone edge. “If we raise levies, we confirm instability. If we accuse sabotage without proof, we look desperate. If we wait, we look weak. Every response pushes us further into the same outcome.”

“So you’re trapped,” she said quietly.

“We are framed,” Thane corrected. “As a problem. Once that happens, the question is no longer whether we’re right, only whether we’re convenient to remove.”

Xeria was silent for a moment. Then, “And your father knows this.”

“He does. Which means he’s already moved past saving the house.”

“And you?” she asked.

Thane closed his eyes. “I’m trying to work out what can still be saved.”

“Xeria,” Thane said quietly, sinking deeper until the water brushed his ears, “I know you’re not just my attendant. So answer me this.” He exhaled, the steam blurring his vision as his thoughts churned. “If we’ve already lost… who, and what, can we still save?”

Xeria didn’t hesitate. “Servants are sent south every winter,” she said. “The cold can be brutal, and we routinely dispatch retinues to merchants and allied houses closer to the heartlands on Stonehome business.”

Thane stilled. It was a thread. Not salvation, but something to hold. “Those routes are already mapped,” he said, sitting up slightly and meeting her gaze.

Her amber eyes remained steady. “They are, young master. Inns, rest points, contacts. No one would question an expanded rotation. The winter has been harsh, after all.”

“That could work,” Thane murmured. “It would look like prudence, not flight.” The shape of a plan began to form, fragile but real. “But it leaves the house thinner. Less defended. Less staffed.”

Xeria inclined her head. “Then some of your brothers should be sent away as well. On missions. Or to pursue higher learning. [[House Stonehome]] is known to be… sedentary.” There was a faint emphasis there. “Framed correctly, it would ease the burden on the household rather than raise concern.”

Thane let the thought settle, then followed it through to its natural conclusion. “If servants can be sent south without question, then heirs can be sent outward,” he said. “Not away. Forward.” He glanced at Xeria. “[[Bastion]].”

She nodded almost immediately.

“Javik and Trello,” Thane continued, already measuring the shape of it. “Javik needs pressure and real opposition, not another winter sparring in a courtyard. And Trello…” He hesitated only a fraction of a second. “Trello will be listened to there. He has presence.”

“Two reasons, then,” Xeria said. “Training, and representation.”

“And absence,” Thane added quietly. “If unrest follows, no one questions heirs being sent to the frontier’s edge to harden them. It looks responsible. Traditional, even.”

Xeria inclined her head. “It will also thin the household without making it appear deliberate.”
Thane closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded to himself. “They leave before the first snowfall.”
After that, the days moved quickly. He fulfilled his father’s wishes to the letter. The plan he devised with Xeria worked—at least at first. Servants were sent from the manor in careful stages, dispatched to everywhere and nowhere at once. By the time anyone thought to ask questions, they were already gone.
From the outside, House Stonehome appeared responsible, even forward-thinking. Two of its lordlings were announced for placement at Bastion Academy, a prudent investment in the future. The rumors spread quietly, carried by the right mouths, reinforced by polite letters and visible restraint. Enough to muddy the narrative. Enough to delay judgment.
It wasn’t enough.
Grain shipments arrived late, then not at all. Stores dwindled. Tempers shortened. Winter crept closer, and with it hunger. The pressure on the estate mounted, subtle at first, then impossible to ignore. Those who stood to benefit from Stonehome’s weakness did not rush—but they did not wait, either.
Whatever Thane had disrupted, they adjusted.
The trap tightened all the same.
