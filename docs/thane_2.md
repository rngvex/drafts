# The Cold Wind Calling

The clinking of metal filled the front yard of the Stonehome estate once more. This time it wasn’t brothers crossing blades, but Thane and his instructor, Trisha Threnbow. At a glance she could have passed for a common adventurer, and that was very much by design. Her slim longsword moved with effortless precision, elegant and economical. She left openings, but never by mistake, each one a lure meant to draw Thane into striking at the wrong moment.

For long stretches, the clash of steel was all that existed. The training was well above the basics, fit for nobility and punishing all the same. Thane focused on footwork and posture, knowing a single lapse would put him on the ground in seconds.

Then she changed pace. Threnbow lunged, closing the distance with her guard still intact. Thane braced and shifted his weight, preparing to block or deflect, but after an hour of relentless pressure his response came a fraction too slow.

“You’ve trained well, young lordling,” she said as she eased back. “The progress is visible. Still too weak for the life of a hunter or adventurer, but soon, I think you could pass as C-rank.”

“Thank you, Miss Threnbow,” Thane replied, steadying his breath. Trisha moved in and hauled Thane up from the ground she had so curtly introduced him to. Xeria stood nearby when he regained his footing, taking a moment to orient himself.

“I’ve been training,” Thane said, catching his breath, “but I see I’m still lacking.”

Trisha snorted softly. “You handle a sword better than most sellswords I’ve seen, but you’re still young. Your father has you training hard. That much even I can tell.” She sounded comfortable saying it, at ease with the lordling.

“I put myself through this training of my own accord,” Thane replied evenly.

“Master Thane,” Xeria said, stepping forward, “are you ready? I’ve drawn a bath for you in your quarters.”

“Ah, I see. Thank you, Xeria. And thank you as well, Mistress Trisha. It was an honor, as always,” Thane said, inclining his head to his instructor before turning and heading in Xeria’s direction. Trisha returned a brief farewell and took her leave.

The walk back toward the manor was uneventful. That, more than anything, unsettled him. Outwardly, Thane moved as he always did, measured, composed. Inside, his thoughts were anything but. His father’s words echoed again and again, striking the same place each time with quiet certainty.

_Our house will not survive._

From the way Sebik had said it, this wasn’t a warning meant to provoke action. It was a statement of fact. A position already reached. And that frightened Thane more than any imagined enemy, because he couldn’t yet see where the last move had been taken—or how many had already passed him by.

“You usually spend more time chatting with your trainers,” Xeria remarked, her voice light, as if noting nothing more than habit.

Thane exhaled slowly. The service corridors were quieter, narrower, stone worn smooth by generations of people meant not to be seen. He preferred them.

“Xeria,” he said after a moment, keeping his eyes forward, “how many moves ahead do you think an opponent needs to be before they know, for certain, that they cannot lose?”

She didn’t answer immediately. That, too, was routine. “Enough that they stop reacting,” she said at last.

Turning left on the third floor, they slipped into a tea kitchen barely large enough for four, completely hidden within the thickness of the outer walls. To anyone not familiar with the routes, it would have seemed as though they had simply appeared on the floor.

From there, Thane stepped into his bathing chamber, Xeria following without comment.

“Please, shut the door,” he said quietly.

Steam from the square, ornate bath had already begun to fog the windowpanes overlooking the gardens beyond. He was grateful, not for the heat itself, but for the fact that it was magically sustained. As he loosened his training gear and began to undress, he spoke more to the air than to her.

“How are we this far behind…”

Sinking into the bath, steam closing around him, Thane finally allowed his thoughts to slow—just enough to hurt. He let the water rise to his shoulders and stared at the fogged glass for a long moment before speaking.  
“Xeria… did you understand what my father and I were discussing earlier?”

She folded her hands at her waist. “I understood that it was important,” she said carefully. “Beyond that, no. Politics was never my training.”

“That’s fine,” Thane replied. He sounded tired now, more than shaken. “This isn’t really about politics anyway. It just wears the shape of it.”

He shifted slightly, the water sloshing. “On the frontier, houses survive because everyone agrees it’s easier to let them. Grain flows, patrols overlap, favors get returned. None of it is written down. It just… works. Until it doesn’t.”

Xeria nodded once, following.

“Our harvest failed,” he continued. “That alone isn’t fatal. Winter always hurts someone. But if grain shipments arrive late, or don’t arrive at all, unrest follows. Not because people are cruel, but because they’re cold and hungry. And unrest gives others permission to act.”

“To intervene,” Xeria said.

“Yes. To ‘restore order.’” Thane’s fingers tightened against the stone edge. “If we raise levies, we confirm instability. If we accuse sabotage without proof, we look desperate. If we wait, we look weak. Every response pushes us further into the same outcome.”

“So you’re trapped,” she said quietly.

“We are framed,” Thane corrected. “As a problem. Once that happens, the question is no longer whether we’re right, only whether we’re convenient to remove.”

Xeria was silent for a moment. Then, “And your father knows this.”

“He does. Which means he’s already moved past saving the house.”

“And you?” she asked.

Thane closed his eyes. “I’m trying to work out what can still be saved.”
