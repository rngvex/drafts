# Thane Of A Cruel World
Thane watched his brothers spar in the courtyard as snow drifted down, slowly carpeting the frontier in white. Steel rang against steel, breath fogged the air, and for a moment the world looked almost peaceful. It wasn’t. Their claim was small, pressed up against the wild edge of Aetera, where survival depended on preparation and mistakes were paid for quickly.

Thane didn’t truly belong here. He wasn’t born to this world, even if it had given him a name and a place in it. Ian had been his name once. Now he was [[Thane Stonehome]] of House Stonehome, sixth heir and of little consequence. While his brothers were trained in chivalry and steel, he had been set to study numbers, management, and arithmetic, the skills required to keep a domain alive when swords alone weren’t enough. He knew how to handle a blade well enough, but it had long since stopped being the point.

The world was interesting, to say the least. In the courtyard, sparks flew as sword met sword. Javik, the fifth heir, shouted an incantation and fire answered, licking along the edge of his blade as heat hissed through the falling snow, melting flakes before they could touch the ground. He was talented, no one could deny that.

“I’m not done yet!” Javik barked as the flames surged with his next strike.

Trello, the second heir, only smirked. He twisted his free hand and the fire broke apart, scattering into harmless sparks before the blade could land. A clean block, a swift kick to the gut, and Javik found himself on his back in the snow.

Trello wiped his brow, breathing steady. “You’re getting better, brother. Still a long way from mastery, but that was a good move.”

Thane could keep tabs on his brothers from the study where his tutors kept him most days. The accounting he was assigned was basic, almost insultingly so, but his father’s wishes were his father’s wishes. It bored him, not because it was difficult, but because it never rose above counting apples. From here, he could still see the courtyard well enough.

The disappointing part of the spar was that Javik would win this same fight within a year at his current pace. Trello, at twenty-eight, was a competent fighter by most accounts, though those accounts tended to come from people with reasons to stay on his good side. Javik, on the other hand, trained under mediocre masters and still possessed a battle sense sharp enough to unsettle even seasoned fighters.

If Trello hadn’t relied on that dispel of his, the outcome would have been far less clean.

The meandering of his tutor was interrupted by Xeria, the maid. She was young, kind, and too composed for her age. The Stonehomes had a habit of taking in orphans for service, raising them to be flawless and unobtrusive, and Xeria fit the pattern.

“Master Thane,” she said softly, “your battlecraft instructor has arrived. Lord Stonehome has requested that you both see him in his study, posthaste.”

Thane followed her down the corridor, the sound of his tutor’s voice fading behind them. His father’s study sat deeper in the keep, away from the noise of the courtyard. When they entered, Lord Stonehome was already standing, hands braced against the desk as if he had forgotten how to sit.

He looked tired. Not the kind that came from long days, but the kind that settled into the shoulders and refused to leave. His eyes flicked to Thane, then away again.

“Sit,” his father said, then, after a pause, “Please.”

Thane did.

Silence stretched. The room felt smaller than it should have.

“I know you understand more than you let on,” Lord Stonehome said at last. There was no accusation in his voice, only resignation. “Numbers, logistics, the things that keep a house standing when swords fail. I have always known.”

Thane waited.

“It was never your place,” his father continued, voice tightening. “You were the sixth. Your brothers needed steel and honor. You needed… freedom from that burden.”

He exhaled slowly. “That was the rule. I believed in it.”

His gaze met Thane’s, and there was no pride there. Only urgency.

“I need you to help them now.”

Thane felt the weight of the request settle slowly, like cold seeping through stone. His father did not break tradition lightly. Lord Sebik Stonehome was a man who believed rules existed precisely so they could be obeyed when they became inconvenient. For him to reach past lineage and role, to ask his sixth son for help, meant the situation was already beyond repair. Crops did not fail quietly on the frontier. Power did not shift without notice. If his father was abandoning custom now, then whatever threatened the house was either too large, too late, or both.

Thane’s thoughts moved where his voice did not. Supply chains failing. Fields that should have held turning barren. Debts being called in all at once. A neighbor emboldened, or a patron withdrawing protection at the wrong moment. None of it would look like open war at first. It never did. And if his father was speaking like this now, then he wasn’t asking Thane to save the house. He was asking him to keep his brothers alive after it fell.

Thane nodded once. Not because he agreed, but because he understood. His brothers had been shaped to fit roles, polished until they reflected exactly what was expected of them. None of them were prepared for a failure that didn’t follow the rules.

The shape of the threat mattered.

“Father, is it—” Thane began, then stopped as his father raised a hand.

Sebik gestured to Xeria. She closed the door without comment, and as the latch settled into place, a quiet pressure spread through the room. The air thickened, sound dampening as a spell of isolation took hold.

“It’s our neighbors,” Lord Stonehome said. His voice was steady, which worried Thane more than anger would have. “The Stormbolts. I believe they’ve executed a coordinated move, one that leaves us without recourse. The sort of conspiracy that doesn’t end in concessions or fines. It ends houses.”

The air was still in the lords study. Sebik looked at thane with seriousness in his eyes that hed seldom seen before. Thanes brows furrowed because he could feel that whatever they were about to talk about was about to be the kind of hypothetical talk, that was anything but.

“The rules of the frontier are simple,” Sebik said. “Together, we survive. Alone, we die. Winter is coming, and our harvest failed this year. For a house our size, that is not a hardship we can endure on our own.”

He paused, fingers tightening against the edge of the desk. “That is why we rely on alliances. On trade. The Riverlands behind us had a strong harvest, did they not?”

Thane nodded once.

“Now imagine,” Sebik continued, voice even, “that the grain meant to see us through winter arrives late. Or not at all. Imagine a letter arrives instead. An apology. A mistake.”

Thane’s thoughts moved quickly. It didn’t fit. Houses like Tricrest built their reputation on supplying the frontier. They did not forget shipments. Errors like that didn’t happen.

Thane nodded. “That would mean it was deliberate.”

“Yes,” Sebik said. “And very fortuitous for our rivals, if it happened in a year like this.” His fingers tightened against the desk’s edge. “A delay like that would strain our stores. Tempers would fray. And if unrest followed…” He didn’t finish the thought. He didn’t need to.

“Especially,” Sebik continued, “if our agents were to discover agitators already working the villages we rule.” The implications settled heavily. If that was true, then the first steps had already been taken. They weren’t approaching a trap. They were inside it.

“Father,” Thane said slowly, seeing the lines close in, “then we have no moves left.” Any response would only hasten what was already unfolding.

“No. We do not,” Sebik said, confirming that this was no exercise or abstraction. “I cannot raise the levies. That would give our rivals the justification they need to intervene. And if I accuse them of sabotage without proof, I will be marked as weak. Either course only hastens the outcome.”

His eyes were dark. Truly so. Sebik Howling-Gale Stonehome was not a frail man. He was built like a wall, the sort others knelt before on stature alone. Broad-shouldered, golden-haired, his face carried the weight of honor and regality without effort.

Now, standing there, he seemed smaller—not in body, but in position. Because what he was about to ask of his fifteen-year-old son was, by every rule he lived by, nothing short of heresy.

“Son,” Sebik said quietly, “the day is fast approaching when we may be attacked.”
He didn’t look away as he continued. “House Stonehome will not survive. But its heirs can.”
Sebik stepped forward and went to one knee before his son.
“You see what others do not,” he said. “You think beyond the rules that bind the rest of us.”
His voice tightened, just once. “When the time comes… make sure your brothers live. Please.”

“I will, Father,” Thane said.

Sebik inclined his head once. “Good. Now please, I believe we have kept Miss Thernbow waiting long enough.” His tone had already hardened, slipping back into something formal and distant.

“Xeria, if you will.”

The pressure in the room eased as the isolation spell unraveled, sound and air returning all at once. Xeria opened the door and stepped aside, inclining her head.

“Young master.”
