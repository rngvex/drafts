# [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] Of A Cruel 
[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] watched his brothers spar in the courtyard as snow drifted down, slowly carpeting the frontier in white. Steel rang against steel, breath fogged the air, and for a moment the world looked almost peaceful.
It wasn’t.
Their [[claim]] was small, pressed against the wild edge of [[Aetera]], where survival depended on preparation and mistakes were paid for quickly.
Lady Erika [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] crossed the hall behind him, her voice low and steady as she spoke with one of the maids. [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] half listened despite himself. There were shortages in the storehouse, nothing dire yet, but enough to warrant adjustment. Meals would be stretched. Ingredients substituted. Quiet changes, made early, before anyone had reason to worry.
“Don’t trouble yourself,” Lady Erika said gently. “We’ll adapt and make what we have last. Winter is harsh to us all.”
She moved on without fuss, already thinking ahead, and the household flowed smoothly in her wake.
[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] turned his attention back to the courtyard, though his tutor’s voice continued to drift nearby, meandering through arithmetic he had long since mastered. He didn’t truly belong here. Not in the way his brothers did, all steel and motion and certainty.
He hadn’t been born to this world, even if it had given him a name and a place within it.
Ian had been his name once.
Now he was [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] of [[House Stonehome]], sixth heir and of little consequence. While his brothers were trained in chivalry and steel, he had been set to study numbers, management, and arithmetic, the skills required to keep a domain alive when swords alone weren’t enough. He knew how to handle a blade well enough, but it had long since stopped being the point.

The world was interesting, to say the least. In the courtyard, sparks flew as sword met sword. [[Javik Stonehome|Javik]], the fifth heir, shouted an incantation and fire answered, licking along the edge of his blade as heat hissed through the falling snow, melting flakes before they could touch the ground. He was talented, no one could deny that.

“I’m not done yet!” [[Javik Stonehome|Javik]] barked as the flames surged with his next strike.

[[Trello Stonehome|Trello]], the second heir, only smirked. He twisted his free hand and the fire broke apart, scattering into harmless sparks before the blade could land. A clean block, a swift kick to the gut, and [[Javik Stonehome|Javik]] found himself on his back in the snow.

[[Trello Stonehome|Trello]] wiped his brow, breathing steady. “You’re getting better, brother. Still a long way from mastery, but that was a good move.”

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] could keep tabs on his brothers from the study where his tutors kept him most days. The accounting he was assigned was basic, almost insultingly so, but his father’s wishes were his father’s wishes. It bored him, not because it was difficult, but because it never rose above counting apples. From here, he could still see the courtyard well enough.

The disappointing part of the spar was that [[Javik Stonehome|Javik]] would win this same fight within a year at his current pace. [[Trello Stonehome|Trello]], at twenty-eight, was a competent fighter by most accounts, though those accounts tended to come from people with reasons to stay on his good side. [[Javik Stonehome|Javik]], on the other hand, trained under mediocre masters and still possessed a battle sense sharp enough to unsettle even seasoned fighters.

If [[Trello Stonehome|Trello]] hadn’t relied on that dispel of his, the outcome would have been far less clean.

The meandering of his tutor was interrupted by [[Xeria]], the maid. She was young, kind, and too composed for her age. The Stonehomes had a habit of taking in orphans for service, raising them to be flawless and unobtrusive, and [[Xeria]] fit the pattern.

“Master [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]],” she said softly, “your battlecraft instructor has arrived. Lord [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] has requested that you both see him in his study, posthaste.”

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] followed her down the corridor, the sound of his tutor’s voice fading behind them. His father’s study sat deeper in the keep, away from the noise of the courtyard. When they entered, Lord [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] was already standing, hands braced against the desk as if he had forgotten how to sit.

He looked tired. Not the kind that came from long days, but the kind that settled into the shoulders and refused to leave. His eyes flicked to [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]], then away again.

“Sit,” his father said, then, after a pause, “Please.”

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] did.

Silence stretched. The room felt smaller than it should have.

“I know you understand more than you let on,” Lord [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] said at last. There was no accusation in his voice, only resignation. “Numbers, logistics, the things that keep a house standing when swords fail. I have always known.”

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] waited.

“It was never your place,” his father continued, voice tightening. “You were the sixth. Your brothers needed steel and honor. You needed… freedom from that burden.”

He exhaled slowly. “That was the rule. I believed in it.”

His gaze met [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]]’s, and there was no pride there. Only urgency.

“I need you to help them now.”

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] felt the weight of the request settle slowly, like cold seeping through stone. His father did not break tradition lightly. Lord Sebik [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] was a man who believed rules existed precisely so they could be obeyed when they became inconvenient. For him to reach past lineage and role, to ask his sixth son for help, meant the situation was already beyond repair. Crops did not fail quietly on the frontier. Power did not shift without notice. If his father was abandoning custom now, then whatever threatened the house was either too large, too late, or both.

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]]’s thoughts moved where his voice did not. Supply chains failing. Fields that should have held turning barren. Debts being called in all at once. A neighbor emboldened, or a patron withdrawing protection at the wrong moment. None of it would look like open war at first. It never did. And if his father was speaking like this now, then he wasn’t asking [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] to save the house. He was asking him to keep his brothers alive after it fell.

[[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] nodded once. Not because he agreed, but because he understood. His brothers had been shaped to fit roles, polished until they reflected exactly what was expected of them. None of them were prepared for a failure that didn’t follow the rules.

The shape of the threat mattered.

“Father, is it—” [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] began, then stopped as his father raised a hand.

Sebik gestured to [[Xeria]]. She closed the door without comment, and as the latch settled into place, a quiet pressure spread through the room. The air thickened, sound dampening as a spell of isolation took hold.

“It’s our neighbors,” Lord [[House Stonehome|Stonehome]] said. His voice was steady, which worried [[Thane Stonehome|Thane]] more than anger would have. “The Stormbolts. I believe they’ve executed a coordinated move, one that leaves us without recourse. The sort of conspiracy that doesn’t end in concessions or fines. It ends houses.”
