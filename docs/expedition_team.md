It had been a full week since the expedition team had left for the depths of the forest outside Bastion Academy. Thane was already asleep in his cot, and most of the team were drifting toward their tents.

In the center of the campsite sat Izzat, the shadow mage, deliberately keeping watch over the fire. Fire guard was one of those duties people forgot about—or never imagined was important—until it failed. The light and heat kept wild monsters at bay, warding them from the camp, and someone always had to tend it.

If they’d brought a fire mage, the flames would’ve been enchanted to last through the night. But someone with Izzat’s skill set was useful too.

He could _feel_ the shadows move—at least, that was how he liked to phrase it when he wanted to sound dark and mysterious. In truth, **Shade Predator** simply attuned his body to motion in the dark. It didn’t help with perception beyond that. His real talents lay elsewhere: removing himself from notice, slipping into places and thoughts he didn’t belong.

The perfect shinobi.

Too bad it made everyone wary of him.

He poked at the fire, adding another log.

Well. Almost everyone.

“You going to stare at that fire all night, handsome?”

Nara stepped into the firelight, tall and self-assured, her silhouette crowned by long bunny ears that cast sharp shadows across the ground. As the expedition’s hunter and tracker, she moved like she owned the dark.

For some reason, she was the only one he couldn’t feel with his skill.

It was something in how she moved — like every single act she chose was designed to annoy, unsettle, or catch someone off guard. This was no exception.

“Well, I’m fire guard for tonight, so… uh. Yes?” he replied, eyes still half-lidded. **Shade Predator** made sleep difficult at the best of times, which was why the watch suited him. At least until sunrise, when he could finally rest.

She flashed him a smirk that spoke of bad ideas already in motion.

Her gaze felt impossible to trick. Like it was always rushing ahead of its target, leading it on — only to circle back and land squarely on the truth. That, more than anything else, unsettled Izzat.

“Then you won’t mind if I join you for a bit, right?”

She sat beside him on the log without waiting for an answer. Close enough that her presence filled his awareness entirely on one side.

It felt like a predator had chosen to sit next to him — deliberately, and without fear. 

She was pretty, strikingly so, but it was the kind of beauty that felt practiced. Weaponized. Every line of her, every look, was meant to draw attention in and unsettle once it arrived. Alluring and dangerous, usually both at once.

Which was strange for a hunter. At least a hunter of wild animals.

Nara was danger incarnate, and Izzat felt like the prey.

She sat and hummed to herself, sounding almost pleased, eyes roaming the camp until she found a stick to prod the fire with. She rose just enough to lean forward, invading his space in the process, close enough to be unmistakably intentional.

He wanted to look, very much so, but knew somewhere deep inside that this was a trap. His eyes stayed fixed on the fire.

“Oh, you’re no fun,” she said, in mock disappointment, before sitting back down again.

“So, you’re the shadow mage our dear leader hired, hmm?” Her eyes narrowed slightly, that inquisitive gaze locking onto him. “Did you know you talk in your sleep when we’re trekking in the wagon?”

The closeness, the direct eye contact, none of it sat well with Izzat. Very little about this situation did.

But there was another problem.

At the mention of sleep talking, his mind betrayed him, pulling up a memory from two nights ago, a dream that clung far too tightly for something meant to fade. Nara Richters, her form uncomfortably vivid, almost intrusive. What unsettled him most was not the content, but the residue, the way the memory felt steeped in his own magic, shadows curling around it like they had never fully let go.

That wasn’t normal.

He had never remembered dreams like that. And he certainly never _felt_ them afterward.

Something extra had been at play.

And now, sitting this close, with the fire snapping between them, it felt like whatever had lingered from that dream was being stirred again.

“Oh,” he said carefully, keeping his eyes on the flames. “That’s something I didn’t know.”

He finally looked at her, just long enough to meet her gaze.

“Were you listening to me?” he asked, half surprised, half worried.

She smirked and stepped into his personal space, close enough that retreat would have been obvious. When their hands met, it was not a touch so much as a collision.

Something sparked, sharp and immediate, passing through both their minds at once.

He felt her want and drive, hot and restless, like a fire barely held in check. It wasn’t directed, not at him, not yet, just force and momentum, the kind that never truly went still.

And she felt his exhaustion, heavy and unyielding, like lead weights settling behind her eyes, the faint taste of iron blooming at the back of her tongue.

There was no confusion about it.

They both knew those weren’t their own thoughts.

It was incidental, but there was no denying it. They could hear, feel, and think each other’s thoughts.

A spike of worry cut through Izzat.

_Oh fuck, what about the dream…_

The moment the thought formed, it was already too late. Memory followed intent, and the dream he had tried not to recall surfaced whole and unguarded, spilling across the shared space between them. Shadows, heat, her presence too vivid to dismiss, all of it unmistakably his.

Nara did not pull her hand away.

She stayed exactly where she was, smirk deepening, amusement rolling off her in a way he could feel as clearly as if it were his own.

Worse, he could feel her reaction to it.

She liked it.

And there was no hiding that, either.
