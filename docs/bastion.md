# Bastion Academy
The stone walls were never quiet in this place. The academy was always being worked on, roofs fixed, insulation improved, reinforcements added inside the walls. And yet, despite the constant construction, the interior still spoke of history. Tiled floors worn smooth, tall hallways meant to move soldiers rather than scholars. The Bastion Academy still had that frontier-fort DNA written into its bones, Instructor Devon Mace thought as he made his way to his first class of the day. The school year had barely begun and already his schedule was full. Some instructors had quit. Others had not been so lucky during the last monster flood. The city was pounded regularly like that. Dungeons, places that existed solely to spawn monsters, sometimes overproduced, and when they did, cities like Bastion’s Reach absorbed the pressure so the Heartland did not have to. Places like this were dangerous, but good for training, good for ambition, good for people chasing a chance to win big. That was why Bastion Academy instructors were so prized. Someone had to make sure these people, some still kids, others adults with nothing left to lose, did not die out there. At least, that was how Devon understood his job, regardless of the competence of his colleagues.

The large doors leading into the auditorium were already open when he arrived. Students filtered in with the break of dawn, filling the semicircular stone seating. Devon made his way to the instructor’s desk at the center of the room, a large blackboard behind it. A small apparatus on the desk ticked steadily. “Alright,” he called out. “We start in three minutes. Workbooks out. If you do not have one, or forgot it, share with a neighbor.” The room shuffled as bags opened and seats shifted. Devon watched the clock, and when it struck the hour, he crossed the room and closed the doors himself. The heavy click echoed through the hall, and the class settled immediately.

“Alright. Settle down,” he said, voice firm. “We will continue where we left off. We covered dungeon ecosystems last session. Today we move on to magic and skills. Does anyone know what mana is?” A girl with white-blond hair raised her hand. “Jane. Go ahead.” She stood. “Mana is the energy we use to fuel the phenomena we call magic. It can be shaped using intent, and through different media such as chants, rituals, and-” “That is enough,” Devon interrupted, raising a hand. “You are correct. Sit.” Jane sat. “Mana exists,” Devon continued. “And most theories suggest it is selective. Picky, even. It responds better to certain ways of communication, which is why we use incantations. Words help us imagine intent. But there is another component. Capacity. The mana core, sometimes called the soul core, is what we use to interface with mana. Think of it like a muscle. The more you use it, the more mana it can handle. Longer casting, shorter bursts, greater intensity. That is the theory.”

He paused briefly. “Now, skills. Anyone?” A girl with long dark hair raised her hand. “Rey.” “Skills are abilities manifested outside the mana core,” she said, then sat. Devon nodded. “Succinct, and accurate. A skill is still a magical phenomenon, but if it does not interface with the mana core directly, we classify it as a skill. For example.” He reached beneath his instructor’s cloak and produced a dagger. Devon drew a slow breath, posture settling as his breathing fell into rhythm with his heart. The air around him stirred, thin currents gathering along his body and the blade in his hand. He tossed an apple into the air and, in one smooth motion, cut it cleanly in half mid-fall, catching both pieces before they hit the ground. He set the dagger down as the currents faded. “That was Wind Slipstream Breathing,” he said. “I did not draw from my mana core. I circulated ambient mana through my body using controlled breathing. Because of that, it is a skill. Does that make sense?”

A boy sitting by himself raised his hand. “Yes, Thane?” Devon said. The brown-haired boy stood. “What about skills that activate by themselves?” Devon paused. Passive skills were rare. Sometimes even cursed. They were treated like a malaise, something that got in the way of living a normal life, like missing a hand or having poor eyesight. “Those are classified as passive skills,” Devon said after a moment. “They are rare because their existence suggests that some part of the body other than the mana core is permanently infused with mana, or possesses a secondary core. It is not a phenomenon we have studied in much depth.” He looked at the boy more closely. “Is there a specific reason for the question, Thane?” “Not really,” Thane replied. “I just read about it the other day.”
