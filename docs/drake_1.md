# Let Dragons Lie


The screaming didn’t stop.
The screaming didn’t stop.
The screaming didn’t stop.
The screaming didn’t _fucking_ stop.

Drake Stormbolt woke in the dark, slick with cold, cloying sweat, his heart hammering as if it meant to tear its way out of his chest. The fire, the terror of what had happened last week, was still fresh in his mind, too fresh. He could still see it, Stonehome burning, figures fleeing their ancestral home as silhouettes against the flames. Guards, maids, servants, bloodied and broken, some beaten past recognition, heads rolling into fresh snow, crimson staining white. A massacre. His stomach was empty and still it heaved when his thoughts circled back to that day, especially when they returned to his father, to the look on his face as he inspected the carnage their own agents had caused.

Glee, a sickening, unguarded happiness, crossed his father’s face when his eyes found old man Sebik, dead in the snow. The expression had been so casual, so unremarkable, that Drake hadn’t understood it at first. Then he had. In that moment, Drake knew he was looking at evil, not madness, not necessity, not duty, but something colder and deeper, the kind of darkness that lives quietly in the human heart. It made him shiver. It made him wish he had never been born.

The shadows felt like they were crawling up the walls, alive. “Alight!” Drake shouted into the air, and the torches around his room burst into flame with a muted huff of ignition. He twisted in the sheets, clutching them in his right hand while his left pressed hard over his eyes, as if he could erase the images by force alone, as if blocking his sight could stop what had already settled into his mind’s eye. His whole body shook, breath coming shallow and uneven.

The door to his room was not burst open. It was pried, slowly, carefully, and two figures slipped inside. Vera and Mona. Attendants by title, though they had grown up with him, more companions than servants, a familiarity his father had never tolerated. “D? Are you alright?” Vera asked quietly from the gap she left between herself and the door. “We heard you moaning and screaming. Is everything okay?”

“I… uh…” Drake tried, the words catching as his chest hitched. He dragged in air, sharp and unsteady, the way he had back then, as though his body hadn’t realized the night was over. “Yeah. I’m fine,” he managed at last, though the tremor never left his hands. “I’m good. Could one of you come in, and the other keep watch? I need to take a shower.”

“Sure, D. I’ll warm the water for you,” Mona said, already moving, slipping past him into the adjoining chamber with quiet steps. She adjusted her round glasses as she went, familiar, practiced. Vera lingered by the door. “You’re still not seeing anyone, Drake?” she asked gently. “You know you can talk to me or Mona, right? About anything.”

“Yeah, I know,” he said, forcing the words out past the tightness in his chest. “I just can’t. Not right now, okay?” He swallowed, then added, quieter, “Send them away if anyone comes. And if it’s my father, use force.” He wasn’t sure if it was a joke, and the fact that he couldn’t tell unsettled him more than the words themselves.

He pushed himself upright by sheer will, the room tilting as he stood. Dawn was still far off, but time had stopped behaving since that day, stretching and folding until everything led back to a single moment. As the memory brushed too close, his pulse spiked and his knees threatened to give. He caught a chair, steadying himself, and made his way toward the bathing chamber, face pale, stomach turning.

The image followed him anyway.

His father’s face, frozen in that expression, joy stretched too wide, grief carved too deep, like a stage mask pressed over living flesh. Not a man reacting to horror, but a role being performed, delight and sorrow worn at the same time. It clung to him as he moved, grotesque and obscene, a lie made permanent, and Drake could not look away.

The memory wouldn’t stay blurred. It sharpened as he moved, dragging itself forward no matter how hard he tried to look away. His father standing in the snow, a severed head held up by the hair, blood matted and dark against his glove. The face was unrecognizable, beaten past dignity, mouth slack, eyes open and empty.

And his father was smiling.

Not thin-lipped satisfaction, not grim resolve, but open, genuine joy. A grin stretched wide as he inspected the damage, as if admiring fine work. The expression sat wrong on his face, too exaggerated, too complete, like a stage mask carved into place, laughter frozen where revulsion should have been. It was the kind of smile meant to be seen, not felt, a performance meant to display delight without understanding what it was attached to.

Drake’s stomach lurched. The world tilted as his body rejected the image outright, knees buckling, breath stuttering as nausea climbed sharp and immediate. He tasted bile and blood and cold air all at once, and no amount of distance or time could soften it. The head, the smile, the joy, they refused to separate, and that impossibility was what made it unbearable.

He fell. The only way he knew was the pain in his knees as they struck something hard and unyielding, the jolt running up through his legs and into his spine. Orientation dissolved. Up felt like down, down felt wrong, left meant nothing at all. His body panicked without him, breath hitching, muscles seizing and releasing in erratic bursts. His hands shook, then everything shook, a full-body tremor that refused to listen, refused to obey. It was as if Drake Stormbolt had been severed from himself, commands issued into a body that no longer recognized them. Sensation and thought blurred together, mixing and grinding until there was no clean edge left between fear, memory, and motion.

Somewhere through the noise, he could barely make out a voice calling for him. His ears rang, a high, piercing drone that swallowed everything else, flattening sound into meaningless vibration. His vision swam, catching only fragments, the blurred shape of feet moving in and out of view, quick and uneven. Panic, but not his. That meant he was looking at the ground, that this was down, that the erratic movement belonged to someone standing over him.

“…e… …ake…”

The sound scraped through the ringing, incomplete, broken, until suddenly it wasn’t. His name struck him like cold water against overheated skin. “Drake!” He turned toward where up should have been, neck protesting as his vision snapped painfully into focus. Mona’s face filled his view, tears streaking down her cheeks, her eyes darting again and again toward the door, fear written openly across her expression.

It hit him harder than the pain, harder than the shaking, a sobering jolt straight through the chest. Whatever had brought her to that look, whatever had made his dear friend afraid enough to cry, it was something he could not ignore. Someone had done this. Someone had made her look like that.

The door flew open. Vera’s body crossed his field of vision like a sack of something heavy, something never meant to move that way, and struck the far wall with a sound that made his bones itch. Stress flooded him all at once, crude and nauseating, a cocktail with nowhere to go, crystallizing into a hot, aching ember behind his ribs. Then, without urgency, without haste, Vivek Stormbolt stepped into the room.

His father. Drunk. Mona stood frozen beside the doorway, eyes wide, breath locked in her chest. Drake felt the cold of the polished stone floor seep into his skin as his hands began to shake again, not with panic this time, but with something tighter, sharper. Vivek swayed slightly as he took another step forward, the easy confidence of a frontier lord still clinging to him even through the haze of drink, strength undiminished by the slur creeping into his speech.

“You thought,” he began, hiccupping wetly, “you could hide away from me, you little runt?” A thin line of red was already spreading where Vera had struck the wall. The sight of it did something to Drake. His jaw clenched, teeth grinding together as if that pressure alone could hold him in place. “Father,” he said, and the word came out smaller than he meant it to, the child in him scrambling for the only shape of safety he knew. “You should go to sleep. It’s very late.”

The obedience was a mask, one he had worn a thousand times before, and he knew even as he put it on that it might not hold.

“Your mother told me the same thing,” Vivek laughed, the sound ugly and loose. “But I haven’t had a good fuck in a while, so I figured I’d feel better if I found one of the maids.” His gaze slid, unfocused, then snapped back with sudden amusement. “And look what I found standing out in the hall.”

It was the nauseating confidence that made him want to vomit. The certainty. The ease with which Vivek occupied the room, as if nothing in it could resist him. The knowledge that he had been sired from the loins of someone this disgusting curdled in Drake’s chest, turning inward, heavy with hate. His heart sank as he understood what his father thought victory looked like, not survival, not dominance, but entitlement worn without shame.

Mona trembled beside him. He could feel it without looking, the subtle vibration carried through the air between them. His entire nervous system screamed, locked in shock, every instinct pulled tight. It felt as though flexing even a single muscle would topple something delicate and irreparable, a domino set precariously atop a house of cards. The room itself seemed to balance on a single, hair-thin thread, stretched to the breaking point.
“You’ve had these two for a while, haven’t you?” Vivek said, the words still thick and uneven as he stepped closer. “And not once did you lay a finger on them.”

He moved before Drake could find his voice. A hand shot out and closed around Mona’s jaw, fingers digging in with careless strength. Her skin blanched under the grip, the pressure immediate and wrong, enough to bruise without effort. She cried out, sharp and startled, the sound tearing free of her before she could stop it.

Drake’s eye twitched. That single noise, small and involuntary, did what the fear and the memory could not. Something inside him tightened, compressed past reason, past restraint, until the pressure became unbearable.

What came from Drake’s mouth was thick and cloying, the words dragged up from somewhere deeper than fear. Menace saturated his voice as the panic inside him metastasized into something harder, denser. “You will not touch them.”

His father’s scoff cut through the room, bemused, dismissive, and that sound was enough. Drake’s hand curled into a fist and drove itself into the stone floor. The impact cracked outward in a shallow crater, the force rippling just enough to upset Vivek’s balance. He stumbled, grip breaking, and Mona fell free, landing hard on her side as Drake lay there, unmoving.

The air changed. Mana gathered around Drake in a dark, wine-crimson haze, thick and viscous, as if it had weight, as if it resisted being drawn at all. It did not flow so much as congeal, pooling low and heavy, pressing outward against the room. The light bent strangely through it, and the space around him felt smaller, tighter, like something ancient had taken a breath and refused to let it go.

Something in Drake smiled. Not with joy, not with relief, but with recognition, a cold acknowledgment of the fury tearing through him, as if it had been waiting for this exact shape of rage. Vivek’s expression shifted, eyes sharpening as he straightened, instinct finally catching up to bravado. Both of them rose at the same time, father and son facing one another across the ruined stone.

Vivek moved first. The broad-shouldered lord stepped in, arm already swinging, the motion reflexive, practiced, a correction delivered a thousand times before. A slap meant to reassert order. To remind a disobedient child of his place.
Drake did not know the words that came out of his mouth. To him they were a garbled collision of vowels and consonants, sounds that defied language, defied being properly heard, and yet he knew what they were all the same, deep in his bones, deeper still.

ㄍㄨˇ ㄒㄩㄝˋ ˋ  
Ancient blood, release.

The pressure that burst outward was not physical at first, but it hurt anyway. It felt as though his soul had been clamped in a vice and tightened until it bowed inward, strained at the edges. His mana core screamed as it was forced to carry something far larger than itself, like trying to funnel a riptide through a pinhole. Energy poured out, wine-red at first, then brightening to orange, then bleaching toward blue, heat and mass asserting themselves, no longer content to remain unseen.

Vivek’s hand never landed.

The air itself resisted him. Something like a barrier had formed around Drake, not shaped, not summoned, but _allowed_, the room behaving as though the forge of the world itself had decided that this blow was unacceptable. Vivek stumbled into that resistance, surprise flashing across his face a heartbeat too late.

Drake moved without thinking.

His fist connected, and the impact carried a satisfaction that sickened him even as it thrilled, a raw, primordial joy, ape-simple and overwhelming, born of absolute supremacy made real. Vivek Stormbolt left the ground, thrown backward with the same careless force he had once used on Drake’s friends, body sailing across the room before gravity remembered its duty.

Vivek groaned as his boots collided with the floor, the impact rattling breath from his chest. It had been a long time since anyone had landed a punch like that. The stupor still clung to him, but adrenaline was already clawing its way through the drink, burning it out of his blood. He spat a curse, furious at himself, furious at the cheap swill, never having imagined that his weak, soft-spoken son was capable of this.

He barely had time to register the thought before something slammed into the wall beside him.

Drake.

His body was burning. Not aflame, but _hot_, coiled and sharp, moving too well, too fast. He had stepped forward and ended up embedded in stone, lodged in the wall where his father had landed a heartbeat earlier, momentum overshooting intent. Drake tore himself free, disoriented by the sudden excess of strength, by the way distance no longer behaved the way he expected it to.

A streak of violet pressure cracked across the room.

Vivek’s counter came into view almost lazily, the swing distorted by Drake’s warped sense of time. He redirected it with his left without thinking, his right shoulder driving forward in the same motion. The contact was brutal and close. Vivek’s body filled Drake’s vision and then vanished from it again, hurled away in the span of a blink, the exchange too fast to feel until it was already over.

In the split second that followed, Drake saw where his father had landed. Crimson streaked the stone, painted in a violent arc across the wall, and Vivek Stormbolt lay at its end, crumpled and screaming, one arm simply no longer part of him. The sight didn’t register all at once. It arrived in pieces, color first, then shape, then meaning.

“Drake…”

The voice dragged him back. Vera’s groan was weak, distant, barely more than breath. His head snapped toward her, heart slamming as his mind raced, gears spinning too fast, ticking toward something final. He hadn’t moved. He didn’t dare. The power still coiled inside him, tight and unstable, and he knew with sudden clarity that any careless step would send him skidding through stone again, a weapon he no longer trusted himself to aim.

Guards were already there.

They poured in around Vivek, trained and fast, barriers flaring to life in layered sheets of pale light. The air thickened as containment fields locked into place, practiced responses snapping into motion. They didn’t look at Drake. Not yet. Their focus was on the injured lord, on keeping him alive, on holding the room together.

The decision came without ceremony.

Drake lifted his arm slowly, inch by inch, wrestling it upward as if it were made of fragile glass, as if the slightest misjudgment would shatter everything left standing. His muscles trembled under the effort of restraint, teeth clenched hard enough to ache. When his hand was finally raised, when he felt just enough control return to trust his own voice, he spoke a word he had been dreaming about for a week straight, the thought of it looping endlessly through his fractured sleep.

A word meant to erase.

“Igni.”

The flame that answered was blue.

It danced from his outstretched fingers in delicate, impossible motions, blooming like watercolor spilled across the air. It was not aimed. It was not shaped. It existed to consume, to release the pressure coiled inside him, and it did exactly that. The mana poured out of him and the fire took it eagerly, spreading with quiet hunger.

The manor resisted.

Its wards flexed and groaned, magical bindings straining like steel wire pulled past tolerance, snapping one by one in sharp, invisible failures. Stone behind Vivek and the clustered guards darkened, blackening first, then flushing red, heat bleeding through until the walls themselves began to glow. Flame licked outward into the hallways, not rushing, not roaring, but advancing with patient certainty, a wave of blue fire seeking space, seeking release.

Glass burst outward in shattering cascades. The roof split and lifted as pressure found its way free. In moments, the Stormbolt manor, grounds and all, was washed in verdant blue light, a cold, brilliant blaze that painted the night sky and turned the estate into a burning silhouette against the dark.

Nothing screamed.

The humming in his bones faded to a dull ache. His breathing came ragged and uneven, but the pressure had eased, not gone, merely quieted enough to let the world return. Sound, weight, distance, all of it settled back into place. Drake tested his footing once, then again, and found that he could move without the room lurching away from him.

Mona was already at Vera’s side. Green light spilled from her hands as she worked, healing magic threading itself through torn flesh and bruised bone. Vera stirred faintly, a sound leaving her throat that was more breath than voice. Drake didn’t wait. There was no time left for hesitation.

He crossed the room and lifted Vera into his arms, the motion smooth despite the exhaustion creeping into his limbs. He crouched, steadying himself, and nodded once at Mona. “On,” he said, voice low and sure. She hesitated only a heartbeat before climbing onto his back, arms locking around his shoulders.

They moved.

The leap carried them farther than it should have, propelled by the last ember of blue flame still clinging to him, a restrained echo of what had just been unleashed. Stone and smoke fell away beneath them as the manor burned behind, a place already becoming something unreal, something left to memory and ash. Drake did not look back. Whatever power still lingered in him was enough for this, enough to carry them away from the house of sin he had once called home.

Toward darkness.  
Toward distance.  
Toward freedom, whatever shape that might take.
